#### Workshop: Geometry of Polynomial System Solving, Optimization and Topology

*October 16 to 20, 2023*


Polynomial systems encode a wide range of non-linear (but static) phenomena which arise in many 
applications. Non-linearity makes them non-trivial to handle, both from complexity and reliability viewpoints. 
Still, because of their importance for key applications e.g. in mechanism design and optimization amongst many others, 
various algorithmic approaches have been developed.
During the last decades, tremendous achievements have been accomplished to design faster algorithms for polynomial system 
solving, extend their capabilities to tackle topological issues and understand their complexities. For instance, 
let us mention new families of algorithms to exploit algebraic and geometric properties of polynomial systems 
and their solution sets such as sparsity or weighted and multi-homogeneity, algorithms for understanding the topology of 
semi-algebraic sets (Betti numbers, connectivity queries), the raise of sums-of-squares certificates to certify emptiness over the reals of polynomial systems through symbolic-numeric approaches, and last but not least, 
the stellar solution to 17th Smale problem by Lairez following previous works from Beltrán, Cucker and Pardo.  

Many challenges remain to be addressed to pave the way towards high performance polynomial system solvers 
tackling large scale applications. Topical issues lie in the combination of efficiency and certification, computing 
exact certificates of emptiness, understanding the geometry of polynomial systems and their solution sets to exploit 
better their properties algorithmically. This workshop will cover broadly all these 
topics.

<p><b>Abstract.</b> We describe a new algorithm for computing Whitney
stratifications of complex projective varieties. The main ingredients are
(a) an algebraic criterion, due to Lê and Teissier, which reformulates
Whitney regularity in terms of conormal spaces and maps, and (b) a new
interpretation of this conormal criterion via ideal saturations, which can
be practically implemented on a computer. We show that this algorithm
improves upon the existing state of the art by several orders of magnitude,
even for relatively small input varieties. This is joint work with Vidit
Nanda (Oxford).</p></details>

<p><b> Abstract. </b>
Multiple classical problems in the formal verification of programs such as
reachability, termination, and template-based synthesis can be reduced to
solving polynomial systems of equations. In this talk, I will describe the
primary objects and these connections. In particular, I will show how the
algebraic and geometric techniques can be applied, enhancing the scalability and
completeness for such problems. </p> </details>
