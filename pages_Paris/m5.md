**Title:** The quadratic equation revisited.

**Abstract**
High school students learn how to express the solution of a quadratic equation
in one unknown in terms of its three coefficients. What does this this formula
matter? We offer an answer in terms of discriminants and data. This lecture
invites the audience to a journey towards non-linear algebra.

#### Workshop: Geometry of Polynomial System Solving, Optimization and Topology

**Organizers:**  [C. D'Andrea](http://www.ub.edu/arcades/cdandrea.html), {{site.lairez}}, {{site.safey}}, {{site.schost}}, [L. Zhi](http://www.mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~lzhi/) 

*October 16 to 20, 2023*

*Location: Amphitheatre Hermite*

Polynomial systems encode a wide range of non-linear (but static) phenomena which arise in many 
applications. Non-linearity makes them non-trivial to handle, both from complexity and reliability viewpoints. 
Still, because of their importance for key applications e.g. in mechanism design and optimization amongst many others, 
various algorithmic approaches have been developed.
During the last decades, tremendous achievements have been accomplished to design faster algorithms for polynomial system 
solving, extend their capabilities to tackle topological issues and understand their complexities. For instance, 
let us mention new families of algorithms to exploit algebraic and geometric properties of polynomial systems 
and their solution sets such as sparsity or weighted and multi-homogeneity, algorithms for understanding the topology of 
semi-algebraic sets (Betti numbers, connectivity queries), the raise of sums-of-squares certificates to certify emptiness over the reals of polynomial systems through symbolic-numeric approaches, and last but not least, 
qualitive advances in the line of Smale's 17th problem.

Many challenges remain to be addressed to pave the way towards high performance polynomial system solvers 
tackling large scale applications. Topical issues lie in the combination of efficiency and certification, computing 
exact certificates of emptiness, understanding the geometry of polynomial systems and their solution sets to exploit 
better their properties algorithmically. This workshop will cover broadly all these 
topics.

and geometric applications </i></summary>
<p><b>Abstract</b>
The tasks of designing innovative mathematical software and of solving complex
research problems using computational methods are strongly mutually dependent.
Developing a new generation of algorithms to considerably push the
computational boundaries of nonlinear algebra, notably addressing polynomial
system solving, is thus envitable. One important task of this process is to no
longer use Gröbner bases only as a black box in higher level algorthms, but to
optimize their computation with the geometric context in mind. In this talk, we
will illustrate this idea by presenting a new algorithm for computing Gröbner
bases of saturated polynomial ideals. Moreover, we introduce msolve, an open
source software package build to provide this new generation of efficient and
optimized algorithms for the community.<br>
The contents of this talk are based on joint work with Jérémy Berthomieu and
Mohab Safey El Din.

<p><b>Abstract</b>
The main object of study in the (algebraic) theory of reaction networks is the solution se of a system of parametric polynomial equations in the positive orthant. This system consists of polynomials
with fixed support, the coefficients are linear in the parameters, but there might be some (proportionality) dependencies among the coefficients. The questions of interest concern properties of this system, and
of its intersection with a family of parallel linear subspaces of complementary dimension. In this case, of relevance is to determine the possible number of zeros the system has when the parameters vary. <br>

In this talk I will introduce the framework and the families of polynomial systems under study in full generality, and having the reaction networks as the main application. I will proceed to discuss recent
results addressing the expected dimension of the solution sets and on how to decide whether the solution set admits a toric parametrization for all parameter values. The latter is relevant for the problem of
counting solutions, and this connection will also be explained in the talk.

Numerical algebraic geometry provides a collection of algorithms
for computing and analyzing solution sets of polynomial systems.  This talk
will discuss new techniques that have been developed in numerical algebraic

<p><b>Abstract.</b> We describe a new algorithm for computing Whitney
stratifications of complex projective varieties. The main ingredients are
(a) an algebraic criterion, due to Lê and Teissier, which reformulates
Whitney regularity in terms of conormal spaces and maps, and (b) a new
interpretation of this conormal criterion via ideal saturations, which can
be practically implemented on a computer. We show that this algorithm
improves upon the existing state of the art by several orders of magnitude,
even for relatively small input varieties. This is joint work with Vidit

<p><b>Abstract</b>
Polynomial optimization deals with optimizing a polynomial function over a feasible region

optimization problems. Hierarchies of tractable semidefinite relaxations have been introduced
that are based on using sums of squares of polynomials as a ``proxy” for global nonnegativity.
These hierarchies give bounds on the global minimum of the original problem with asymptotic
convergence (under a minor compactness assumption). In this lecture we discuss recent results on
the performance analysis of these hierarchies and related effective degree bounds for dedicated
sums of squares representations of positive polynomials on some classes of compact semi-algebraic
sets (including the hypercube, the sphere or the ball).

<p><b>Abstract</b>
In this talk, I will present the connections between chordal graphs from graph theory
and triangular decomposition in top-down style from symbolic computation, including the
underlying theories, algorithms, and applications in biology. Viewing triangular decomposition in
top-down style as polynomial generalization of Gaussian elimination, we show that all the
polynomial sets, including all the computed triangular sets, appearing in several typical
top-down algorithms for triangular decomposition have associated graphs which are subgraphs of
the chordal graph of the input polynomial set. These theoretical results can be interpreted as
“triangular decomposition in top-down style preserves chordality” and are further used to design
sparse triangular decomposition for polynomial sets which are sparse with respect to their
variables. Sparse triangular decomposition is shown to be more efficient than ordinary one
experimentally, and its application on computing equilibria of biological dynamic systems will
also be reported.<br />

<details><summary><a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Bernard.Mourrain/">Bernard Mourrain</a> (Inria, Sophia-Antipolis) <i>Solving by duality</i></summary>
<p><b>Abstract.</b>
Finding the common roots of a set of polynomial equations is a problem that
appears in many contexts and applications. Standard approaches for solving
this difficult question, such as Grobner bases, border basis, triangular sets,
etc. are based on polynomial reductions but their instability against
numerical approximations can be critical.
In this talk, we will describe a dual approach which focuses on linear
functionals vanishing at the roots.
We will review the properties of Truncated Normal Forms, the connexion with
classical computer algebra approaches and resultants. We will also detail the
dual approach in the context of optimisation problems and for analysing
isolated singularities.
Examples from geometric modeling, robotics and tensor decomposition will
illustrate the numerical behavior of these dual methods.

The Vandermonde map is the polynomial map given by the power-sum polynomials.
We study the geometry of the image of the nonnegative orthant under under this map and focus
on the limit as the number of variables approaches infinity. We will show, the geometry of this
limit is the key to new undecidability results in nonnegativity of symmetric polynomials and
deciding validity of trace inequalities in linear algebra.

<p><b>Abstract.</b>
A classical method to compute with sparse polynomials is to homogenize them
with respect to Newton polytopes, regarding them as homogeneous elements of
Cartier degrees in the Cox ring of a projective toric variety. In this talk,
we
investigate subvarieties defined by generic polynomial systems in the Cox ring
when the degrees are non-necessarily Cartier, with a view towards identifying
alternative toric homogenizations that are suitable for practical
computations.

#### Topical day: Mechanism Design and Computer Algebra

*October 24, 2023*

**Organizer:** [J. Schicho](https://www3.risc.jku.at/people/jschicho)

*Location: Amphitheatre Darboux*


**Speakers.** [Maria Alberich-Carraminana](https://mat.upc.edu/en/people/maria.alberich), [Didier Henrion](https://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/),

**Schedule**: 

- 9h30-10h30 [J. Schicho](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/staff/josef-schicho), 
- 11h-12h00 Mechanisms from Motions – Rational and Algebraic [H.-P.
   Schröcker](https://www.uibk.ac.at/de/geometrie-vermessung/team/schroecker/)
   <details><summary>Abstract.</summary> The factorization of rational motions
   has been introduced about a decade ago. On a kinematics level it corresponds
   to the decomposition of a rational motion into elementary motions (rotations,
   translations, ...) The mathematics behind is the factorization of special
   polynomials over non-commutative rings into linear factors. This talk gives
   an overview about the past decade of motion factorization and explains many
   of the underlying constructions of mechanisms at hand of animations. It will
   also feature a new geometric factorization algorithm that highlights the
   importance of “kinematics at infinity” and gives rise to an extension of the
   factorization theory from rational to algebraic motions. </details>
- 14h-15h Inverse kinematics with computer algebra and the Lasserre hierarchy 
     [D. Henrion](https://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/)
     <details><summary>Abstract.</summary>
     The Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem consists of finding robot
control parameters to bring it into a desired position under kinematics and
collision constraints. We describe a global solution to the optimal IK problem
for a general serial manipulator with 7 degrees of freedom (7DOF) with
revolute joints. Classical modeling yields a polynomial optimization problem
with constraints of degree four. A direct application of the moment-SOS (sums
of squares) aka Lasserre hierarchy generates semidefinite optimization
problems which are too large for state-of-the-art numerical solvers. Using
computer algebra (Groebner basis computations), we show that the kinematic
constraints due to rotations can all be generated by degree two polynomials.
On this reduced problem, we demonstrate that the second relaxation of the
Lasserre hierarchy is sufficient to solve the 7DOF IK problem on a KUKA LBR
IIWA manipulator and we show that we are able to compute the optimal IK or
certify infeasibility in 99% of the tested poses. This is joint work with
Pavel Trutman (Prague), Tomas Pajdla (Prague) and Mohab Safey El Din (Paris).

        Finding the common roots of a set of polynomial equations is a problem that
appears in many contexts and applications. Standard approaches for solving
this difficult question, such as Grobner bases, border basis, triangular sets,
etc. are based on polynomial reductions but their instability against
numerical approximations can be critical.
In this talk, we will describe a dual approach which focuses on linear
functionals vanishing at the roots.
We will review the properties of Truncated Normal Forms, the connexion with
classical computer algebra approaches and resultants. We will also detail the
dual approach in the context of optimisation problems and for analysing
isolated singularities.
Examples from geometric modeling, robotics and tensor decomposition will
illustrate the numerical behavior of these dual methods.

        <blockquote>Abstract.
        In this work in progress with Lorenzo Baldi and Bernard Mourrain, we extend
previous results on univariate rational sums of squares, obtained with
Bernard and Agnes Szanto, to
the case of a non-negative rational polynomial on a basic zero-dimensional
semi-algebraic set defined by rational polynomials.

        <blockquote>Abstract. 
        We describe a new algorithm for computing Whitney
stratifications of complex projective varieties. The main ingredients are
(a) an algebraic criterion, due to Lê and Teissier, which reformulates
Whitney regularity in terms of conormal spaces and maps, and (b) a new
interpretation of this conormal criterion via ideal saturations, which can
be practically implemented on a computer. We show that this algorithm
improves upon the existing state of the art by several orders of magnitude,
even for relatively small input varieties. This is joint work with Vidit
Nanda (Oxford).

        <blockquote>Abstract.
        The Vandermonde map is the polynomial map given by the power-sum polynomials.
We study the geometry of the image of the nonnegative orthant under under this map and focus
on the limit as the number of variables approaches infinity. We will show, the geometry of this
limit is the key to new undecidability results in nonnegativity of symmetric polynomials and
deciding validity of trace inequalities in linear algebra.

and geometric applications</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract.
        The tasks of designing innovative mathematical software and of solving complex
research problems using computational methods are strongly mutually dependent.
Developing a new generation of algorithms to considerably push the
computational boundaries of nonlinear algebra, notably addressing polynomial
system solving, is thus envitable. One important task of this process is to no
longer use Gröbner bases only as a black box in higher level algorthms, but to
optimize their computation with the geometric context in mind. In this talk, we
will illustrate this idea by presenting a new algorithm for computing Gröbner
bases of saturated polynomial ideals. Moreover, we introduce msolve, an open
source software package build to provide this new generation of efficient and
optimized algorithms for the community.
The contents of this talk are based on joint work with Jérémy Berthomieu and
Mohab Safey El Din.
