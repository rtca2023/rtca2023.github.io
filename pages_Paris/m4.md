    <details><summary>Integer multiplication in time $O(n \log n)$ <a href="https://www.texmacs.org/joris/main/joris.html">Joris van der Hoeven</a>, CNRS, LIX, Palaiseau</summary> <blockquote>Abstract.
Integer multiplication is one of the oldest mathematical operations and
still a central problem for computer arithmetic.  The complexities of
many other basic operations such as division, base conversion, gcds,
computing $e$ and $\pi$, FFTs, etc. can be expressed in terms of the complexity
of integer multiplication.  In our talk, we will survey a new algorithm
for multiplying two $n$-digit integers in time $O(n \log n)$.

#### Workshop: Fundamental Algorithms and Algorithmic Complexity

 **Organizers:** [J. van der Hoeven](https://www.texmacs.org/joris/main/joris.html), {{site.giesbrecht}}, 
[P. Koiran](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/pascal.koiran), {{site.villard}} 

 *September 25 to 29, 2023*

The field of computational complexity aims at understanding the 
capabilities of computational devices and especially how fast 
various problems can be solved.  A lot of research focuses on 
isolating and studying complexity classes of those problems
that can be solved using  a certain amount of resources.  One 
of the most interesting and challenging problem in the area of 
computer algebra, is to develop tools and methods in 
complexity theory that also reflects running
times that are observed in practice, for a wide selection of data 
types. The computer algebra research community indeed produces 
software that proceed on various mathematical objects and 
having high impact. This requires expertise from many areas 
of computer science and of mathematics. 

This workshop aims 
at bringing together experts from both the theoretical and more 
practical sides, while covering a wide spectrum of problems 
from algebra, geometry, symbolic computation, arithmetic, 
   and numerical computation.
Specific challenges that the workshop will focus on include the 
following: polynomials in complexity, structured problems, tensors, 
complexity and specification, certificates and their links with 
delegated computation, efficiency in crypto-algebro algorithms, 
HPC implementation of core algorithms, complexity 
in numerical analysis.

floating-point numbers, of the form $s 2^e$, where $s$ and $e$ are
integers with a fixed precision. This representation is compact and can
represent numbers with small and large magnitudes. In this talk, we will
generalize this idea to approximate univariate polynomial functions with
piecewise polynomials of the form $s(X) X^e$ where $s$ is a polynomial
of fixed degree and $e$ is an integer. Using tools such as the Newton
polygon, this representation can be computed efficiently both in theory
and in practice. Moreover, it can be used to efficiently evaluate and
find roots approximations of a high-degree polynomial.

    <td><details><summary>First-order factors of linear Mahler operators</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract. We develop and compare two algorithms for computing first-order right-hand factors in the
ring of linear Mahler operators
$\ell_r M^r + \dots + \ell_1 M + \ell_0$
where $\ell_0, \dots, \ell_r$ are polynomials in $x$ and $Mx = x^b M$ for some
integer $b \geq 2$.
In other words, we give algorithms for finding all formal infinite product
solutions of linear functional equations
$\ell_r(x) f(x^{b^r}) + \dots + \ell_1(x) f(x^b) + \ell_0(x) f(x) = 0$.<br/>

The first of our algorithms is adapted from Petkovšek's classical algorithm for
the analogous problem in the case of linear recurrences.
The second one proceeds
by computing a basis of generalized power series solutions of the functional equation
and by using Hermite-Padé approximants to detect those linear combinations of the solutions
that correspond to first-order factors.<br/>

We present implementations of both algorithms and discuss their use
in combination with criteria from the literature
to prove the differential transcendance of power series solutions of Mahler
equations.

    <td><details><summary>Matrix multiplication via Lie groups</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract. Cohn and Umans proposed a group-theoretic approach to bounding the exponent of matrix multiplication. Previous work within this approach ruled out certain families of groups as a route to obtaining $\omega=2$, while other families of groups remain potentially viable. In this work we turn our attention to matrix groups, whose usefulness within this framework was relatively unexplored.<br/>

To study these groups, we propose working in the continuous setting of Lie groups, in which we develop an analogous theory. Obtaining the analogue of exponent $2$ in this potentially easier setting is a key challenge that represents an intermediate goal short of actually proving $\omega = 2$.  We give constructions in the continuous setting which are indeed best-possible in a precise sense. <br/>

We then describe a new ingredient -- "separating polynomials" -- which allow us to recover a full-fledged framework yielding actual (finite) algorithms in the Lie group setting, rather than constructions whose interest is only by analogy. This framework has some mathematically pleasing features: the notion of border rank arises naturally from the Lie algebra, and we have machinery that points to the main open question being that of finding a separating polynomial of appropriate degree in a certain ring of invariant polynomials.<br/>  

This is based on joint work with Jonah Blasiak, Henry Cohn, Josh Grochow, and Kevin Pratt.

    <td><details><summary>Superpolynomial lower bounds against low-depth algebraic circuits</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract. An algebraic circuit computes a polynomial using addition and multiplication operators. Understanding the power of algebraic circuits has close connections to understanding general computation. Despite this, not many lower bounds are known for even simple Sigma Pi Sigma (product-depth 1) circuits. Before our work, the best known lower bound for product-depth 1 circuit was (slightly less than) cubic. No lower bounds were known for general product-depth 2 circuits.<br/>

In this work, we show the first superpolynomial lower bound for low-product-depth algebraic circuits.
In the talk, we discuss the main results and present the proof ideas used in the proof of the superpolynomial lower bound for product-depth 1 circuits.<br/>

This talk is based on joint work with Nutan Limaye and Srikanth Srinivasan.

    <td><details><summary>Border rank, homogeneity and de-bordering paradigms in GCT</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract. Border (or approximative) complexity of polynomials plays an integral role in GCT (Geometric Complexity Theory) approach to P!=NP. This raises an important basic question: can arbitrary approximations of simple polynomials involve exponential-precision which may not be efficiently simulable? Circuits of depth 3 or 4, are a good testing ground for this question. Recently, Kumar proved that *any* polynomial f can be approximated arbitrarily well by restrictions of the polynomial x1 ... xn - 1 for n large enough. In this talk, we will see a stronger connection (& reverse) of this result with the border rank of f, and how homogeneity can play an important role in border complexity. <br/>

Furthermore, we will see the border of constant top-fanin depth-3 circuits (which is far more general than x1...xn -1) is relatively easy & hierarchical - it can be computed by a polynomial-size algebraic branching program (ABP). <br/>

This is based on the joint works with -- 1) Prateek Dwivedi & Nitin Saxena (FOCS'21) 2) Nitin Saxena (FOCS'22) 3) Fulvio Gesmundo, Christian Ikenmeyer, Gorav Jindal and Vladimir Lysikov (submitted).

        <blockquote>Abstract. Riemann—Roch spaces are a cornerstone of modern applications of algebra to various areas of computer science: error correcting codes, secret sharing, multi-party computations, zero-knowledge proofs, resilience in distributed storage systems, interactive oracle proofs... Best performances are achieved for specific families of spaces known to be difficult to compute.<br/>

We will present a new probabilistic algorithm of Las Vegas type that computes Riemann—Roch spaces of plane projective curves in expected sub-quadratic time whenever the characteristic is zero or positive but sufficiently large. The method relies on the Brill—Noether theory (1874), bivariate polynomial elimination, Puiseux series expansions, and structured polynomial matrices. In case of curves with only ordinary singularities, we will present a faster variant that even supports any characteristic.<br/>

This is joint work with Simon Abelard (Thales SIX GTS, France), Elena Berardini (CNRS, University of Bordeaux, France), Alain Couvreur (Inria Saclay, France).

    <td><details><summary>Computing the non-commutative rank of linear matrices</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract. The topic of the talk connects skew-fields, polynomial identity testing,
invariant theory and optimization. By a linear matrix we mean a matrix
having homogeneous linear entries and the non-commutative rank 
is the rank when we consider the variables as elements of the appropriate 
free skew-field. Computing it is a relaxation of determining the maximal
rank of a matrix in a given linear space of matrices. A remarkable 
characterization can be given in terms of a large common zero block 
of the coefficient matrices after a change of basis. 
We will present the main ideas of a deterministic polynomial time
algorithm that computes the noncom-mutative rank. Note that existence of
an efficient deterministic method computing the ordinary rank
is a famous open problem in polynomial identity testing. The algorithm
gives lower and upper witnesses for the rank. The lower witness is 
a polynomial invariant of a sub-matrix while the upper witness is 
given by a common zero block. We will also discuss some applications 
of the algorithm. <br/>
The talk is based on joint works with Youming Qiao 
and K. V. Subrahmanyam.

    <td><details><summary>Closure of algebraic complexity classes under factoring</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract. Polynomial factoring is one of the most fundamental problems in the area of computational algebra. Its variants have attracted a huge amount of attention in the last half-a-century. On the other hand, algebraic complexity theory classifies polynomials, into complexity classes, according to computational resources. Could we show that these classes afford polynomial factoring algorithms? <br/>

In this talk we will focus on four algebraic complexity classes--- size-s circuits VP$_{nb}$, size-s degree-s circuits VP, size-s degree-s verifier circuits VNP, and size-s algebraic branching programs VBP. We will discuss the algebraic methods, inspired from analysis, that have been developed to do factoring in these complexity classes. We will list the open questions and make some related conjectures.

        <blockquote>Abstract. The non-negativity of a function on a finite abelian group can be certified by its Fourier sum of squares (FSOS). We propose a method of certifying the nonnegativity of an integer valued function by an FSOS certificate, which is defined to be an FSOS with a small error. We prove the existence of exponentially sparse polynomial and rational FSOS certificates and provide two methods to validate them.  As a consequence of the aforementioned existence theorems, we propose a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based algorithm to efficiently compute a sparse FSOS certificate. For applications, we consider certificate problems for maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT) and maximum k-colorable subgraph (MkCS) and demonstrate our theoretical results and algorithm by numerical experiments.<br/>

        <blockquote>Abstract. Sparse polynomials with integer coefficients are a basic building block in computer algebra systems, as well as an important fundamental object for algorithmic study. Since at least the 1980s, efficient algorithms have been constructed based on the flexibility afforded by changing the integer modulus repeatedly during the computation. This talk will attempt to briefly survey some of the modulus-choosing techniques employed in recent results to achieve faster algorithms. We will also briefly examine when these techniques (fail to) extend to the case of floating point computations and field extensions.
