 *September 25 to 29, 2023*

The field of computational complexity aims at understanding the 
capabilities of computational devices and especially how fast 
various problems can be solved.  A lot of research focuses on 
isolating and studying complexity classes of those problems
that can be solved using  a certain amount of resources.  One 
of the most interesting and challenging problem in the area of 
computer algebra, is to develop tools and methods in 
complexity theory that also reflects running
times that are observed in practice, for a wide selection of data 
types. The computer algebra research community indeed produces 
software that proceed on various mathematical objects and 
having high impact. This requires expertise from many areas 
of computer science and of mathematics. 

This workshop aims 
at bringing together experts from both the theoretical and more 
practical sides, while covering a wide spectrum of problems 
from algebra, geometry, symbolic computation, arithmetic, 
   and numerical computation.
Specific challenges that the workshop will focus on include the 
following: polynomials in complexity, structured problems, tensors, 
complexity and specification, certificates and their links with 
delegated computation, efficiency in crypto-algebro algorithms, 
HPC implementation of core algorithms, complexity 
in numerical analysis.
