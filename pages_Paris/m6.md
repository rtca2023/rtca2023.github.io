#### Workshop: Computer Algebra for Functional Equations in Combinatorics and Physics

*December 4 to 8, 2023 (Amphitheater Hermite)*

**Organizers**:  {{site.bostan}},

In many areas of pure and applied mathematics, as well as in computer science and in theoretical physics,
functional equations form either the object of study or important tools for applications.
We are currently experiencing increasingly strong interactions between theory and applications, many common actions having taken place over the past ten years.
By functional equations, we mean mainly ordinary differential equations, with differences, with $q$-differences, Mahlerian, linear or algebraic, possibly multivariate.
For instance, nonlinear algebraic differential equations emerge naturally in integrable models in physics
(Painlevé equations, Schlesinger systems, KdV equations, etc., associated with Lax pairs,  Yang-Baxter equations,...).
All these types of functional equations have been and are still very actively studied from many points of view, using algebraic, arithmetic and geometric tools.
A recent trend is that computer algebra algorithms are more and more used to solve functional equations arising in enumerative combinatorics and in statistical physics.
Notable examples come from questions related to lattice walks.
In combinatorics, basic objects like trees, maps, permutations,  and Young tableaux can be represented by models of walks confined to cones.
In physics, many objects, including polymers and queueing models, are accurately modeled by walks on lattices, particularly those evolving in cones with several  boundaries. 
This workshop brings together representatives from the three different communities (computer algebra, combinatorics and theoretical physics) to discuss longstanding conjectures, to learn each other's techniques and to plan the directions for the future.

        <blockquote>Abstract. 
		We establish exact formulae for the (positivity) persistence probabilities of an autoregressive sequence with symmetric uniform innovations in terms of certain families of polynomials, most notably a family introduced by Mallows and Riordan as enumerators of finite labeled trees when ordered by inversions. The connection of these polynomials with the volumes of certain polytopes is also discussed. Two further results provide factorizations of general autoregressive models, one for negative drifts with continuous innovations, and one for positive drifts with continuous and symmetric innovations. The second factorization extends a classical universal formula of Sparre Andersen for symmetric random walks. Our results also lead to explicit asymptotic estimates for the persistence probabilities. This is a joint work with Gerold Alsmeyer, Alin Bostan and Thomas Simon (Adv. Appl. Math., 2023).

        <blockquote>Abstract.
		The appearance of a stretched exponential term 
		\[\mu^{n^{\sigma}}\]
		with $\mu>0$ and $\sigma \in (0,1)$ in a counting sequence $(c_n)_{n\geq0}$ is not common, although more and more examples are appearing lately. Proving that a sequence has a stretched exponential is often quite difficult. This is in part because such a sequence cannot be "very nice": its generating function cannot be algebraic, and it can only be D-finite if it has an irregular singularity. 

		Previously, the saddle-point method was the only generic method for proving such a phenomenon, but it requires detailed information about the generating function. Recently, together with Andrew Elvey Price and Wenjie Fang, we have developed a new method at the level of recurrences to prove stretched exponentials.  I will introduce the basics of this method and show how it can be extended to other problems. Then I will summarize recent progress (new bijections, limit laws, etc.) in the study of compacted trees, a subclass of directed acyclic graphs. Finally, I will give an outlook on how these results now allow an in-depth study of limit shapes and open many new avenues for further research.

    <td><details><summary>Summation Tools for Combinatorics and Elementary Particle Physics</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract.
		The summation theory of difference rings provides general and efficient tools to derive linear recurrences for
		definite sums based on parameterized telescoping and to solve recurrences within the class
		of indefinite nested sums defined over hypergeometric products, q-hypergeometric products and more
		generally, mixed hypergeometric products and their nested versions. In particular, one can
		use these techniques to simplify definite multi-sums to representations in terms of the class
		indefinite nested sums defined over indefinite nested products. A special feature is that the representation of
		the arising sums and products are optimal in the sense that the objects interpreted as sequences
		(except root of unity products) do not satisfy any algebraic relations among each other.
		This leads not only to compact expressions in the final output, but also speeds up significantly the underlying
		summation algorithms. In particular, one gains a general (Galois) machinery to prove algorithmically
		algebraic independence of big classes of sums and products. We will illustrate this algorithmic difference ring
		toolbox by non-trivial applications coming from enumerative combinatorics and elementary particle physics.

		Quadratization problem is, given a system of ODEs with polynomial right-hand side, transform the system to a system with quadratic right-hand side by introducing new variables. Such transformations have been used, for example, as a preprocessing step by model order reduction methods and for transforming chemical reaction networks. We will present a recent algorithm for computing such transformations and its extensions including systems with control and of varying dimension. The talk is based on joint works with Andrey Bychkov, Opal Issan, and Boris Kramer.

    <td><details><summary>Submodule approach to creative telescoping</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract.
		This talk proposes ideas to speed up the process of creative telescoping, particularly when the telescoper is reducible.
		One can interpret telescoping as computing an annihilator $L$ in $D$ for an element $H$ in a D-module $M$.
		The main idea is to look for submodules of $M$. For a non-trivial submodule $N$, constructing the minimal operator $R$ of the image
		of $H$ in $M/N$ gives a right-factor of $L$ in $D$. Then $L = L' R$ where $L'$ is the telescoper of $R(H)$.
		To expedite computing $L'$, compute the action of $D$ on a natural basis of $N$, then obtain the telescoper $L'$ for $R(H)$ with
		a cyclic vector computation.

		The next main idea is that when $N$ has automorphisms, use them to construct submodules. An automorphism with distinct eigenvalues
		can be used to decompose $N$ as a direct sum of submodules $N_1, \ldots, N_k$.  Then $L' = \text{LCLM}(L_1, \ldots, L_k)$ where $L_i$ is the telescoper of
		the projection of $R(H)$ on $N_i$. An LCLM can greatly increase the degrees of the coefficients, so $L'$ and hence $L$ can be much larger
		than the factors $L_1, \ldots, L_k$ and $R$. Examples show that computing each factor $L_i$ and $R$ separately can save a lot of CPU time
		compared to computing the full telescoper $L$ all at once with standard creative telescoping.

    <td><details><summary>Some problems I’d like solved, from a user of computer algebra</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract.
			A matrix $M$ of real numbers is called {\em totally positive}\/
			if every minor of $M$ is nonnegative.  Gantmakher and Krein showed
			in 1937 that a Hankel matrix $H = (a_{i+j})_{i,j \ge 0}$
			of real numbers is totally positive if and only if the underlying
			sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$ is a Stieltjes moment sequence,
			i.e.~the moments of a positive measure on $[0,\infty)$.
			Moreover, this holds if and only if the ordinary generating function
			$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n t^n$ can be expanded as a Stieltjes-type
			continued fraction with nonnegative coefficients.
			So totally positive Hankel matrices are closely connected with
			the Stieltjes moment problem and with continued fractions.
			Here I will introduce a generalization:  a matrix $M$ of polynomials
			(in some set of indeterminates) will be called
			{\em coefficientwise totally positive}\/ if every minor of $M$
			is a polynomial with nonnegative coefficients.   And a sequence
			$(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$ of polynomials will be called
			{\em coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive}\/ if the Hankel matrix
			$H = (a_{i+j})_{i,j \ge 0}$  associated to $(a_n)$ is coefficientwise
			totally positive.  It turns out that many sequences of polynomials
			arising naturally in enumerative combinatorics are (empirically)
			coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive.  In some cases this can
			be proven using continued fractions, by either combinatorial or
			algebraic methods;  in other cases this can be done using a more general
			algebraic method called {\em production matrices}\/.  However, in a very
			large number of other cases it remains an open problem.
			Along the way I will mention some problems in computer algebra,
			the solution of which would be helpful to this research.

        <blockquote>Abstract.
		Feynman integrals are a type of mathematical function that are important for precision measurements in physics. They are notoriously difficult to evaluate, and a lot of effort has been devoted to developing efficient analytic and numerical methods for doing so.

		In this talk, we will present a new algorithm for determining the minimal order Picard-Fuchs operator associated with a given Feynman integral. This operator is a differential operator that governs the analytic behavior of the Feynman integral.

		We will first discuss an implementation of the Griffiths-Dwork algorithm for the case of Feynman integrals in integer spacetime dimension. In that case, the integrand of the Feynman integral is a rational differential form to which the Griffiths-Dwork reduction is applied for determining the Picard-Fuchs operator.

		We will then extend this algorithm to the case of generic spacetime dimension. In this case, one needs to consider twisted cohomology.

		We will show how the knowledge of the Picard-Fuchs operator can be deduced by Hodge theoretic considerations on the variation of the mixed Hodge structure associated to the Feynman integral.

		This talk is based on work with Pierre Lairez, Eric Pichon-Pharabod, Charles Doran, and Andrew Harder.

		We give an improved algorithm for the enumeration of self-avoiding walks and polygons within an $N \times N$ square as well as SAWs crossing a square. We present some proofs of the expected asymptotic behaviour as the size $N$ of the square grows, and then show how one can numerically estimate the parameters in the asymptotic expression. We then show how the improved algorithm can be adapted to count gerrymander sequences (OEIS A348456), and prove that the asymptotics of the gerrymander sequence is similar to that of SAWs crossing a square. This work has been  done in collaboration with Iwan Jensen, and in part with Aleks Owczarek.

          <blockquote>Abstract.
We define a new disordered asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with two species of particles, first-class and second-class, on a two-dimensional toroidal lattice. The dynamics is controlled by first-class particles, which only move horizontally, with forward and backward hopping rates $p_i$ and $q_i$ respectively if the particle is on row $i$. The motion of second-class particles depends on the relative position of these with respect to the first-class ones, and can be both horizontal and vertical.
In the first part of my talk, I will illustrate how we used computer algebra software, specifically Mathematica and SageMath, to understand the stationary distribution of this process. We computed the partition
function, as well as densities and currents of all particles in the steady state. We observed a novel mechanism we call the Scott Russell phenomenon: the current of second class particles in the vertical direction is the same as that of first-class particles in the horizontal
direction. In the second part of my talk, I will show how we simulated the process and realized that the Scott Russell phenomenon also holds out of equilibrium.
This is partly joint work with P. Nadeau (European Journal of Combinatorics, 2022).

</summary>
        <blockquote>Maryna Viazovska in 2016 found a remarkable application of the theory of modular forms to a fundamental problem in geometry, obtaining a solution to the sphere packing problem in dimension 8 through an explicit construction of a so-called "magic function" that she defined in terms of classical functions, the Eisenstein series and Jacobi thetanull functions. The same method also led shortly afterwards to the solution of the sphere packing in dimension 24 by her and several collaborators.

		One component of Viazovska's proof consisted of proving a pair of inequalities satisfied by the modular forms she constructed. Viazovska gave a proof of these inequalities that relied in an essential way on computer calculations. In this talk I will present a new proof of Viazovska's inequalities that uses only elementary arguments that can be easily checked by a human.

        <blockquote>A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is $n$. A partition identity is a theorem stating that for all $n$, the number of partitions of $n$ satisfying some conditions equals the number of partitions of $n$ satisfying some other conditions. In this talk, we will show how functional equations and computer algebra can be used to prove such identities. In particular we will discuss a semi-automatic method using recurrences and $q$-difference equations, and what would be needed to make it fully automatic.

        <blockquote>Abstract.
		The simplest examples of integrability in mathematical physics - spectral distributions of fundamental random matrix ensembles or the diagonal spin-spin correlations of the square lattice Ising model - to give just two examples, reveal the importance and practical utility of the six Painlevé equations in our understanding of these models. Few aspects of this understanding escape the presence of these equations, whether it is the application of Riemann-Hilbert methods to the asymptotic limits as matrix ranks or spin separations tend to infinity or the relationships inherited from the affine Weyl group symmetries of the Painlevé equations. This understanding operates in both directions: fundamental understanding of the Painlevé equations provides the most powerful and rigorous tools to characterise a variety of statistics applied to the models, and these applications are driving and motivating a lot of studies into the pure mathematics at the core of these equations.

		However today we coming up against numerous examples where one can pose questions just outside the simplest models: e.g. the singular value distribution of a product of two Ginibre random matrices, or the diagonal correlations of the triangular Ising model or even the off-diagonal correlations of the square lattice model, and one is beyond the six Painlevé set or even the discrete Sakai scheme. Integrability is still present and some of this territory - the Garnier, Fuji-Suzuki, Sasano and matrix-Painlevé systems - has been sketched out but there are gaps in our understanding and our tool-box is missing critical tools that one needs. In some senses the complexity has grown and it is often impractical to do hand-calculations and when computer-assisted systems are employed our best results so far cannot be analysed by hand. There are hints that simplicity is achievable yet the standard computer assisted algorithms do not find them. 

		So the challenge is to develop some flexible, model-adapted algorithms for doing what are essentially algebraic geometry calculations. A number of examples, including those mentioned previously, will illustrate this state of affairs.

		While reading books, Fermat often added notes in the margin
for himself. The most famous one is certainly what is called
nowadays Fermat's Last Theorem which stipulates that the
equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no nontrivial solution as soon
as $n > 2$. More than three centuries of effort were needed
to eventually write down a proof of this result.
In this presentation, I will discuss another margin-theorem
by Fermat. It is less known but still quite impressive as it
took almost two centuries to the community to obtain a full
proof, opening as a byproduct new topics of research.</blockquote></details>

     <br/> 
	 <a href="DocM6/Mezzarobba.pdf">Slides</a>
 	</summary> <blockquote>Abstract.
In the computation of linearly recurrent sequences, round-off errors
arising from each step tend to “cancel out” rather than just accumulate.
This phenomenon is crucial to consider when aiming to establish
realistic error bounds. That requires a close examination of how a given
round-off error propagates through the remaining iterations of the
recurrence. Doing so using traditional “sequence” notations results in
intricate calculations involving nested sums. However, in other
contexts, such as enumerative combinatorics, the use of generating
series to encode sequences simplifies these calculations while
simultaneously granting access to powerful new analytic tools. In this
talk, I will show how the idea of using generating series can be adapted
to the error analysis of numerical algorithms based on linear recurrence
relations.

synthesizing summands or integrands that telescope, called certificates. We describe a creative telescoping algorithm
that computes telescopers for definite sums or integrals of D-finite functions as well as the associated certificates
in a compact form. In the integral case, the algorithm relies on a generalization of the Hermite reduction in
symbolic integration. In the sum case, the algorithm relies on a discrete analogue of the generalized Hermite
reduction, or equivalently, a generalization of the Abramov-Petkovsek reduction. We present a Maple implementation
with good timings on a variety of examples. </blockquote></details>

     <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~mmishna/">Marni Mishna</a>, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada
     <br/> 
	 <a href="DocM6/Mishna.pdf">Slides</a>
 	</summary> <blockquote>The problem of understanding the structure of transcendental objects has fascinated mathematicians for well over a century.  Combinatorics provides an intuitive framework to study power series. A combinatorial family is associated to a power series in $\mathbb{Q}[[t]]$ via its enumerative generating function wherein the number of objects of size $n$ is the coefficient of $t^n$.  Twentieth century combinatorics and theoretical computer science provided characterizations of classes with rational and algebraic generating functions. Finding natural extensions of these correspondences has been a motivating goal of enumerative combinatorics for several decades. This talk will focus on differentially transcendental functions. 
In particular, I will present recent work completed with Lucia Di Vizio and Gwladys Fernandes which characterizes solutions $f(t)$ of order 1 iterative equations of the form $f(R(t))=a(t)f(t)+b(t)$ where $R,a$, and $b$ are rational functions. These appear in the study of complete trees, walks on self-similar graphs (eg. the Sierpinski graph), and pattern avoiding permutations. The proof strategy is inspired by the Galois theory of functional equations, and relies on the property of the dynamics of $R(t)$, Liouville-Rosenlicht's theorem and Ax' theorem. This program and has led to progress in identifying the differential transcendence of combinatorial generating functions arising in the literature, and indeed generally.

	<details><summary><em> Differential elimination ideals and spectral curves </em> </summary>
	<blockquote>Abstract.
		Commuting pairs of ordinary differential operators have been
		related to plane algebraic curves at least since the work of
		Burchnall and Chaundy a century ago. This talk is devoted to the
		revision of some classical results, using now a differential algebra
		framework and, oriented to the development of algorithms based in
		the computation of differential resultants. The new concept of
		Burchnall-Chaundy ideal of a commuting pair will be presented,
		as the ideal of all constant coefficient bivariate polynomials
		satisfied by the pair. This prime ideal will be proved equal to the
		radical of a differential elimination ideal and the defining ideal
		of a plane algebraic curve, the spectral curve of a commuting pair.
		We are motivated by the development of a Picard-Vessiot theory for
		spectral problems, in the case of algebro-geometric ordinary differential
		operator, which are intrinsically linked to the study of integrable hierarchies.

	<details><summary><em>Solving equations from combinatorics via computer algebra</em> </summary>
	<blockquote>Abstract. 
	Enumerative combinatorics contains a vast landscape of problems that
	could hardly be solved without the consideration of special functional equations
	called “Discrete Differential Equations”. Among these problems, the enumeration
	of walks, planar maps carrying hard particles, etc. These functional equations 
	relate formal power series in n variables with specializations of them to some of the
	variables (the specializations being generating functions related to the enumeration of interest). 
	When the involved variables are “nested”, a celebrated result by
	Popescu (1986) implies algebraicity of the solutions. In 2006, Bousquet-Mélou
	and Jehanne provided an elementary proof of algebraicity of the solutions in the
	case $n = 2$. Their proof yields an algorithm, and it has been the state-of-the-art
	in enumerative combinatorics for solving these equations since then. In this talk,
	I will present a recent approach, based on the intensive use of effective algebraic
	geometry, in order to solve more efficiently such equations in the case $n = 2$. Also,
	I will introduce and discuss recent advances in the case of systems of such equations.
	The talk is based on joint works with Alin Bostan, Mohab Safey El Din and Sergey Yurkevich.

	This talk addresses the use of functional equations obtained from computer algebra in the structural properties study of nonlinear dynamical models. For several years, they were exploited in the context of identifiability and diagnosticability studies. A final application was recently developed and concerns an a priori study for the reconstruction of some variables of interest in nonlinear complex networks with an application on a C. elegans chemotaxis network.

    <blockquote>Abstract. This talk gives an introduction to the Thomas decomposition method
	for systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. A Thomas decomposition is a finite family of so-called simple differential systems, each of which is formally integrable, and such that the solution set of the given PDE system is the disjoint union of the solution sets of the simple systems. This versatile technique allows solving differential elimination problems, for example, for the analysis of certain structural properties of nonlinear control systems. The Thomas decomposition method has been implemented in Maple.
