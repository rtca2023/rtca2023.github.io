		While reading books, Fermat often added notes in the margin
for himself. The most famous one is certainly what is called
nowadays Fermat's Last Theorem which stipulates that the
equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no nontrivial solution as soon
as $n > 2$. More than three centuries of effort were needed
to eventually write down a proof of this result.
In this presentation, I will discuss another margin-theorem
by Fermat. It is less known but still quite impressive as it
took almost two centuries to the community to obtain a full
proof, opening as a byproduct new topics of research.</blockquote></details>

 	</summary> <blockquote>Abstract.
In the computation of linearly recurrent sequences, round-off errors
arising from each step tend to “cancel out” rather than just accumulate.
This phenomenon is crucial to consider when aiming to establish
realistic error bounds. That requires a close examination of how a given
round-off error propagates through the remaining iterations of the
recurrence. Doing so using traditional “sequence” notations results in
intricate calculations involving nested sums. However, in other
contexts, such as enumerative combinatorics, the use of generating
series to encode sequences simplifies these calculations while
simultaneously granting access to powerful new analytic tools. In this
talk, I will show how the idea of using generating series can be adapted
to the error analysis of numerical algorithms based on linear recurrence
relations.

in a compact form. In the integral case, the algorithm relies on a generalization of the Hermite reduction in
symbolic integration. In the sum case, the algorithm relies on a discrete analogue of the generalized Hermite
reduction, or equivalently, a generalization of the Abramov-Petkovsek reduction. We present a Maple implementation

#### Workshop: Computer Algebra for Functional Equations in Combinatorics and Physics

*December 4 to 8, 2023 (Amphitheater Hermite)*

**Organizers**:  {{site.bostan}}, 
[J. Bouttier](https://perso.imj-prg.fr/jeremie-bouttier/),
[T. Cluzeau](https://www.unilim.fr/pages_perso/thomas.cluzeau/), [L. Di Vizio](https://divizio.joomla.com/), [C. Krattenthaler](https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~kratt/), {{site.lairez}}, [J.-M. Maillard](https://www.lptmc.jussieu.fr/users/maillard)


In many areas of pure and applied mathematics, as well as in computer science and in theoretical physics,
functional equations form either the object of study or important tools for applications.
We are currently experiencing increasingly strong interactions between theory and applications, many common actions having taken place over the past ten years.
By functional equations, we mean mainly ordinary differential equations, with differences, with $q$-differences, Mahlerian, linear or algebraic, possibly multivariate.
For instance, nonlinear algebraic differential equations emerge naturally in integrable models in physics
(Painlevé equations, Schlesinger systems, KdV equations, etc., associated with Lax pairs,  Yang-Baxter equations,...).
All these types of functional equations have been and are still very actively studied from many points of view, using algebraic, arithmetic and geometric tools.
A recent trend is that computer algebra algorithms are more and more used to solve functional equations arising in enumerative combinatorics and in statistical physics.
Notable examples come from questions related to lattice walks.
In combinatorics, basic objects like trees, maps, permutations,  and Young tableaux can be represented by models of walks confined to cones.
In physics, many objects, including polymers and queueing models, are accurately modeled by walks on lattices, particularly those evolving in cones with several  boundaries. 
This workshop brings together representatives from the three different communities (computer algebra, combinatorics and theoretical physics) to discuss longstanding conjectures, to learn each other's techniques and to plan the directions for the future.

        <blockquote>Abstract.
		The appearance of a stretched exponential term 
		\[\mu^{n^{\sigma}}\] 
		with $\mu>0$ and $\sigma \in (0,1)$ in a counting sequence $(c_n)_{n\geq0}$ is not common, although more and more examples are appearing lately. Proving that a sequence has a stretched exponential is often quite difficult. This is in part because such a sequence cannot be "very nice": its generating function cannot be algebraic, and it can only be D-finite if it has an irregular singularity. 

		Previously, the saddle-point method was the only generic method for proving such a phenomenon, but it requires detailed information about the generating function. Recently, together with Andrew Elvey Price and Wenjie Fang, we have developed a new method at the level of recurrences to prove stretched exponentials.  I will introduce the basics of this method and show how it can be extended to other problems. Then I will summarize recent progress (new bijections, limit laws, etc.) in the study of compacted trees, a subclass of directed acyclic graphs. Finally, I will give an outlook on how these results now allow an in-depth study of limit shapes and open many new avenues for further research.

    <td><details><summary>Summation Tools for Combinatorics and Elementary Particle Physics</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract.
		The summation theory of difference rings provides general and efficient tools to derive linear recurrences for
		definite sums based on parameterized telescoping and to solve recurrences within the class
		of indefinite nested sums defined over hypergeometric products, q-hypergeometric products and more
		generally, mixed hypergeometric products and their nested versions. In particular, one can
		use these techniques to simplify definite multi-sums to representations in terms of the class
		indefinite nested sums defined over indefinite nested products. A special feature is that the representation of
		the arising sums and products are optimal in the sense that the objects interpreted as sequences
		(except root of unity products) do not satisfy any algebraic relations among each other.
		This leads not only to compact expressions in the final output, but also speeds up significantly the underlying
		summation algorithms. In particular, one gains a general (Galois) machinery to prove algorithmically
		algebraic independence of big classes of sums and products. We will illustrate this algorithmic difference ring
		toolbox by non-trivial applications coming from enumerative combinatorics and elementary particle physics.

        <blockquote>Abstract.
		Feynman integrals are a type of mathematical function that are important for precision measurements in physics. They are notoriously difficult to evaluate, and a lot of effort has been devoted to developing efficient analytic and numerical methods for doing so.

		In this talk, we will present a new algorithm for determining the minimal order Picard-Fuchs operator associated with a given Feynman integral. This operator is a differential operator that governs the analytic behavior of the Feynman integral.

		We will first discuss an implementation of the Griffiths-Dwork algorithm for the case of Feynman integrals in integer spacetime dimension. In that case, the integrand of the Feynman integral is a rational differential form to which the Griffiths-Dwork reduction is applied for determining the Picard-Fuchs operator.

		We will then extend this algorithm to the case of generic spacetime dimension. In this case, one needs to consider twisted cohomology.

		We will show how the knowledge of the Picard-Fuchs operator can be deduced by Hodge theoretic considerations on the variation of the mixed Hodge structure associated to the Feynman integral.

		This talk is based on work with Pierre Lairez, Eric Pichon-Pharabod, Charles Doran, and Andrew Harder.

		We give an improved algorithm for the enumeration of self-avoiding walks and polygons within an $N \times N$ square as well as SAWs crossing a square. We present some proofs of the expected asymptotic behaviour as the size $N$ of the square grows, and then show how one can numerically estimate the parameters in the asymptotic expression. We then show how the improved algorithm can be adapted to count gerrymander sequences (OEIS A348456), and prove that the asymptotics of the gerrymander sequence is similar to that of SAWs crossing a square. This work has been  done in collaboration with Iwan Jensen, and in part with Aleks Owczarek.

   	   The multispecies totally asymmetric long-range exclusion process (mTALREP) is an interacting particle system with multiple species of particles on a finite ring where the hopping rates are site-dependent. (The homogeneous variant on Z is also known as the Hammersley–Aldous–Diaconis process.) In its simplest variant with a single species, a particle at a given site will hop to the first available site clockwise. We show that the partition function of this process is intimately related to the classical Macdonald polynomial and to the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). We also show that well-known families of symmetric polynomials appear as expectations in the stationary distribution of important observables. This is joint work with James Martin and Omer Angel.

    <td><details><summary>A new proof of Viazovska's modular form inequalities for sphere packing in dimension 8
</summary>
        <blockquote>Maryna Viazovska in 2016 found a remarkable application of the theory of modular forms to a fundamental problem in geometry, obtaining a solution to the sphere packing problem in dimension 8 through an explicit construction of a so-called "magic function" that she defined in terms of classical functions, the Eisenstein series and Jacobi thetanull functions. The same method also led shortly afterwards to the solution of the sphere packing in dimension 24 by her and several collaborators.

		One component of Viazovska's proof consisted of proving a pair of inequalities satisfied by the modular forms she constructed. Viazovska gave a proof of these inequalities that relied in an essential way on computer calculations. In this talk I will present a new proof of Viazovska's inequalities that uses only elementary arguments that can be easily checked by a human.

        <blockquote>A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is $n$. A partition identity is a theorem stating that for all $n$, the number of partitions of $n$ satisfying some conditions equals the number of partitions of $n$ satisfying some other conditions. In this talk, we will show how functional equations and computer algebra can be used to prove such identities. In particular we will discuss a semi-automatic method using recurrences and $q$-difference equations, and what would be needed to make it fully automatic.

    <td><details><summary>Beyond Painlevé: The need for computational tools to reveal hidden structure</summary>
        <blockquote>Abstract.
		The simplest examples of integrability in mathematical physics - spectral distributions of fundamental random matrix ensembles or the diagonal spin-spin correlations of the square lattice Ising model - to give just two examples, reveal the importance and practical utility of the six Painlevé equations in our understanding of these models. Few aspects of this understanding escape the presence of these equations, whether it is the application of Riemann-Hilbert methods to the asymptotic limits as matrix ranks or spin separations tend to infinity or the relationships inherited from the affine Weyl group symmetries of the Painlevé equations. This understanding operates in both directions: fundamental understanding of the Painlevé equations provides the most powerful and rigorous tools to characterise a variety of statistics applied to the models, and these applications are driving and motivating a lot of studies into the pure mathematics at the core of these equations.

		However today we coming up against numerous examples where one can pose questions just outside the simplest models: e.g. the singular value distribution of a product of two Ginibre random matrices, or the diagonal correlations of the triangular Ising model or even the off-diagonal correlations of the square lattice model, and one is beyond the six Painlevé set or even the discrete Sakai scheme. Integrability is still present and some of this territory - the Garnier, Fuji-Suzuki, Sasano and matrix-Painlevé systems - has been sketched out but there are gaps in our understanding and our tool-box is missing critical tools that one needs. In some senses the complexity has grown and it is often impractical to do hand-calculations and when computer-assisted systems are employed our best results so far cannot be analysed by hand. There are hints that simplicity is achievable yet the standard computer assisted algorithms do not find them. 

		So the challenge is to develop some flexible, model-adapted algorithms for doing what are essentially algebraic geometry calculations. A number of examples, including those mentioned previously, will illustrate this state of affairs.
